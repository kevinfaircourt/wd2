<h1>The wisdom of Abraham Lincoln</h1>
<div id="quotes">
    <p>Have I not destroyed my enemy when I have made him into my friend?</p>
    <p>The best way to predict your future is to create it.</p>
    <p>Most folks are as happy as they make up their minds to be.</p>
    <p>Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves.</p>
