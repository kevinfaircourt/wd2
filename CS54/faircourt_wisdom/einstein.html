<h1>The wisdom of Albert Einstein</h1>
<div id="quotes">
    <p>Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe.</p>
    <p>A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. So is a lot.</p>
    <p>You have to learn the rules of the game. And then you have to play better than anyone else.</p>
    <p>Life is Like a bicycle, to keep your balance, you must keep moving.</p>
