<h1>The wisdom of Martin Luther King</h1>
<div id="quotes">
    <p>Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that.</p>
    <p>We have flown the air like birds and swum the sea like fishes, but have yet to learn the simple act of walking the earth like brothers.</p>
    <p>The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.</p>
    <p>I have decided to stick with love. Hate is too great a burden to bear.</p>
